# 3D-Orientation-Tracking

The project involved conducting IMU calibration and leveraging Python libraries such as JAX and JAXNumPy to implement a 
Gradient Descent algorithm for optimizing quaternion trajectories. By calibrating the IMU and utilizing advanced optimization 
techniques, the project aimed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of orientation estimation in inertial navigation systems.
This approach is crucial for various applications, including robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality, 
where precise orientation estimation is essential for accurate motion tracking and navigation.

As a result, it plots a comparison of optimized orientation with the ground truth data.

# How to run the code?
